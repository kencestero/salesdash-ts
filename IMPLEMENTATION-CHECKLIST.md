## ‚úÖ PRIORITY #2: Clean Mock Data & Fix Profile Display

### Task 4: Clear Mock Notifications ‚úÖ (DOING NOW)
- [x] Empty fake notifications array
- [ ] Connect to real notification system (Firebase or Prisma)
- [ ] Show real user alerts

### Task 8: Username System
**Answer to your question:** Names come from **Gmail** (Google OAuth)!

When users sign in with Google:
```javascript
// From Google OAuth automatically:
session.user.name = "Kenneth Cestero Campos"  // From Gmail
session.user.email = "kencestero@gmail.com"   // From Gmail
session.user.image = "https://..."            // From Gmail profile pic
```

**Username Options:**
- [ ] **Option A:** Auto-generate from email: `@kencestero` (from kencestero@gmail.com)
- [ ] **Option B:** Let users customize in Settings page
- [ ] **Option C:** Use full name from Gmail as-is

**Decision:** Which do you prefer?

### Task 10: Replace Mock Profile Data
- [ ] Update header to show real user name (from Google)
- [ ] Remove hardcoded "Jennyfer Franking"
- [ ] Remove fake follower counts (24.5K/22.5K)
- [ ] Connect "Information" panel to UserProfile table
- [ ] Show real joining date from database
- [ ] Pull real user photo from Google OAuth

**Status:** Ready after Task 4

---

## ‚úÖ PRIORITY #3: Role Management System

### Task 5: Manual Role Assignment (Manager Dashboard)

**You asked: "Can managers give roles through dashboard or backend?"**

**Answer:** YES! Best approach:

**Backend Setup:**
1. Add to `UserProfile` table (already exists):
```prisma
model UserProfile {
  role String @default("salesperson")
  // "owner", "manager", "salesperson"
}
```

2. Create API route: `/app/api/admin/users/[id]/role/route.ts`
   - Only accessible by owners/managers
   - Update user role in database

**Frontend Dashboard:**
1. Create page: `/app/[lang]/(dashboard)/admin/users/page.tsx`
   - Table of all users
   - Dropdown to change role
   - Only visible to owners/managers

**Who can assign roles:**
- ‚úÖ **Owners** (in OWNERS env var) ‚Üí Can assign ANY role
- ‚úÖ **Managers** (in MANAGERS env var) ‚Üí Can assign "salesperson" only
- ‚ùå **Salesperson** ‚Üí Cannot assign roles

**ENV vars location:**
- In Vercel dashboard: Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Locally: `.env.local` file

**Current values:**
```
OWNERS=kencestero@gmail.com,mjcargotrailers@gmail.com,Mightneedoil@gmail.com
MANAGERS=brianjtrailers@gmail.com,danmjtrailers@gmail.com
```

**Workflow:**
1. User signs in with Google ‚Üí Auto-assigned "salesperson"
2. If email in OWNERS ‚Üí Auto-assigned "owner"
3. If email in MANAGERS ‚Üí Auto-assigned "manager"
4. Owners can change anyone's role via dashboard
5. Managers can promote salespeople to manager

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add role check on signin (auto-assign from env vars)
- [ ] Create `/admin/users` page (table + role dropdown)
- [ ] Add permission middleware
- [ ] Create role update API endpoint
- [ ] Add role badges in user list

**Status:** Ready to build

## ‚úÖ PRIORITY #4: Activity Tracking System

### Task 9: Make Activity Timeline Functional

**You said: "I thought Prisma was for this? Tracking"**

**Answer:** YES! Prisma is PERFECT for this. Here's the plan:

### Step 1: Add Activity Model to Database
```prisma
model Activity {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId    String
  type      String   // "profile_updated", "lead_created", "deal_won"
  title     String   // "User Photo Changed"
  message   String   // "Jane Doe changed their avatar photo"
  metadata  Json?    // Extra data: { photoUrl: "..." }
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())

  user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

### Step 2: Track Events Automatically
Every action creates an activity:
- User updates profile ‚Üí Log activity
- Salesperson creates lead ‚Üí Log activity
- Deal is won ‚Üí Log activity
- Task completed ‚Üí Log activity

### Step 3: Display Real Activities
Replace fake timeline with real database queries:
```typescript
// Get recent activities
const activities = await prisma.activity.findMany({
  where: { userId: session.user.id },
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
  take: 20
});
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add Activity model to Prisma schema
- [ ] Run database migration
- [ ] Create helper function: `logActivity(userId, type, title, message)`
- [ ] Hook into user actions (profile updates, CRM actions, etc.)
- [ ] Update activity timeline component to query database
- [ ] Add real-time updates (optional)

**Status:** Ready to implement
