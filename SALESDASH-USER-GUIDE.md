## System Architecture (For Admins)

### Environment Variables

**Required:**
- `AUTH_SECRET` - Used for code generation
- `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` - Google OAuth Client ID
- `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` - Google OAuth Secret
- `DATABASE_URL` - Prisma database connection
- `OWNERS` - Comma-separated owner emails
- `MANAGERS` - Comma-separated manager emails

### Database Schema

**User Table:**
- Standard NextAuth user data
- Links to UserProfile via `userId`

**UserProfile Table:**
- `role`: "owner" | "manager" | "salesperson"
- `member`: Boolean (join code verified)
- `phone`, `city`, `zip`: Optional user details

### Code Generation Logic

```typescript
// Location: lib/joinCode.ts

// Get today's date (NY timezone)
const stamp = getTodayStamp(); // "2025-10-07"

// Generate code for specific role
const salt = `${stamp}-${role}`; // "2025-10-07-manager"
const hash = crypto.createHmac("sha256", AUTH_SECRET)
  .update(salt)
  .digest("hex");
const code = hash.slice(0, 6).toUpperCase(); // "A1B2C3"
```

### Authentication Flow

1. User enters code ‚Üí `/api/join/validate`
2. Code validated ‚Üí Role stored in cookie
3. User signs in with Google ‚Üí NextAuth callback
4. UserProfile created with role from cookie
5. Session includes user role
6. Cookies cleared
7. User redirected to dashboard
