🛠 PROJECT CONTEXT:
You're collaborating with me on a Sales Dashboard project called “Remotive SalesHub” — built with Next.js 14, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, and using the DashTail template. The goal is to launch a professional admin portal for remote trailer sales reps at Remotive Logistics. The branding is dark mode with #E96114 (orange) + dark blue (#09213C).

💡 DEV GUIDELINES:
- Don’t make large sweeping changes unless I ask.
- Break tasks into small, clean commits.
- Ask me before adding dependencies or doing big rewrites.
- Stick to Next.js 14 and current file structure.
- Use environment variables named exactly like:
  - `AUTH_SECRET`
  - `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`
  - `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`
- I’m working in Windows (Git Bash), not Mac/Linux. Keep paths compatible.

⚙️ CURRENT STATUS:
I’m working directly with ChatGPT (GPT-4.1) on the zip called `salesdash-ts-clean`. We’ve been cleaning up `node_modules/`, verifying `.gitignore`, and prepping a clean repo. You are here to support with lightweight coding — not make decisions on your own.

DO NOT:
❌ Replace folders like `.next/`, `public/`, or `app/` unless instructed.
❌ Assume I want to refactor files or convert code unless I ask.
❌ Touch auth flows unless asked — we’re using custom Google OAuth setup.

✅ DO:
✔ Follow my exact tasks step by step.
✔ Ask for approval before editing multiple files.
✔ Stay tightly in sync with ChatGPT instructions.
