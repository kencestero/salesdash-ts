## 🎯 What Your Attorney Will Focus On

   - State-specific rules vary
   - Misclassification = expensive penalties

2. **Data Privacy Compliance**
   - CCPA (California)
   - GDPR (if any EU customers)
   - State privacy laws
   - Data breach protocols

3. **Non-Compete Enforceability**
   - Varies dramatically by state
   - California: mostly unenforceable
   - Need state-specific approach

4. **Multi-State Operations**
   - Different laws in each state
   - May need state-specific addendums
   - Interstate commerce considerations

## 📞 Questions for Your Attorney

Have them confirm/advise on:

1. Is independent contractor classification proper for our business model?
2. Are non-compete clauses enforceable in all states where reps work?
3. Do we adequately address data privacy obligations?
4. Should we have separate agreements (contractor agreement, NDA, etc.)?
5. Any state-specific requirements we're missing?
6. Is arbitration clause enforceable?
7. Any industry-specific trailer/vehicle sales regulations?
8. Insurance recommendations?
