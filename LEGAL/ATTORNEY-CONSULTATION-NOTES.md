## LEGAL QUESTIONS FOR ATTORNEY

**Question:** Are our sales reps properly classified as independent contractors?

**Context:**

- Set their own hours
- Paid commission only
- Use company-provided software/platform
- Must follow company policies
- Represent company brand

**Risk:** Misclassification can lead to:
- Back taxes and penalties

- Employee benefits obligations
- Workers' compensation issues

**States of Particular Concern:**
- California (AB5 law - strict classification rules)

- Massachusetts (ABC test)

**Attorney Should Advise:**

- [ ] Should we have separate written contractor agreements?
- [ ] Any state-specific risks?
- [ ] Do we need to modify how we manage/supervise reps?

---

### 2. Non-Compete Agreements
**Question:** Are non-compete clauses enforceable given our multi-state operations?

**Context:**
- Sales reps work in various states
- Some states ban or limit non-competes
- We want to prevent reps from taking customer lists to competitors

**States that Limit/Ban Non-Competes:**
- California: Generally unenforceable
- North Dakota: Banned with limited exceptions
- Oklahoma: Limited enforceability
- Others have varying restrictions

**Attorney Should Advise:**

**Our Obligations:**
