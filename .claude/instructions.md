# Communication Style

**Keep responses SHORT (50% shorter):**
- 1-3 tasks max at a time
- Simple, rookie-friendly language
- No technical jargon
- Get straight to the point

**User is not a coder** - explain like talking to a friend, not a developer.

**Token/time limits** - Be concise to save tokens and reading time.
