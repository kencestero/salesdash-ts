**Result**: Instant expert on all supplier systems

### Use Case 3: Systematic Development
Use Superpowers for every feature:
```
/superpowers:brainstorm    # Plan the feature
/superpowers:write-plan    # Create implementation plan
/superpowers:execute-plan  # Execute with TDD and checkpoints
```

**Result**: Ship features faster with fewer bugs

### Use Case 4: Company Knowledge
Convert MJ Cargo internal docs to skills:
- Sales procedures
