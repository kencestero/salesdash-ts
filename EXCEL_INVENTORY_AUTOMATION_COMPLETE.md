# ‚úÖ Excel Inventory Automation System - COMPLETE

**Status:** Ready for deployment and testing  
**Date:** October 24, 2025

---

## üéØ What Was Built

A **bulletproof Excel inventory import system** that eliminates manual data entry (9 hours/week) by automating inventory uploads from Diamond Cargo, Quality Cargo, and Panther Cargo.

### Core Features

1. **Dual-Format Parser Engine**
   - **Diamond Cargo**: Parses their complex 34-column Excel with data starting at row 7
   - **Quality Cargo**: Parses their simpler 11-column format with data starting at row 2
   - **Panther Cargo**: Auto-detects dump/open trailer categories
   - Smart error handling - skips bad rows, reports issues

2. **Smart VIN Matching**
   - Checks for existing trailers by VIN
   - Updates pricing/specs if VIN already exists
   - Creates new trailer records for unknown VINs
   - Tracks all changes in database

3. **Image Integration**
   - Auto-matches trailer images by VIN from `/public/images/trailers/`
   - Falls back to placeholder if image not found
   - Ready for 3D mockup integration

4. **Audit & Reporting**
   - Creates `UploadReport` for each import showing:
     - Total trailers imported
     - New vs updated counts
     - All changed VINs
     - Any errors encountered
   - Full history available via `/api/inventory/upload-excel` GET

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- **`/app/api/inventory/upload-excel/route.ts`** - Main upload endpoint
  - 400+ lines of bulletproof parsing logic
  - Handles all 3 manufacturers with correct column mapping
  - Role-based access control (owners/directors only)
  - Full error reporting

- **`/app/[lang]/(dashboard)/(apps)/inventory/upload/page-view.tsx`** - Updated UI
  - Simplified 3-manufacturer grid
  - Real-time upload status
  - Better success/error feedback
  - Improved instructions

### Column Mappings (Verified)

**Diamond Cargo** (AVAILBLE sheet):
- Col 2: VIN
- Col 6: MODEL
- Col 7: COLOR
- Col 10: HEIGHT
- Col 18: PRICE
- Col 34: NOTES/OPTIONS

**Quality Cargo** (PLAIN UNITS sheet):
- Col 1: VIN
- Col 2: BASE PRICE
- Col 3: DISCOUNT
- Col 4: FINAL PRICE
- Col 5: MODEL (6X10TA, 6X12TA, etc.)
- Col 6: COLOR
- Col 9: DOOR TYPE

**Panther Cargo**:
- Auto-detects from first sheet
- Flexible parsing for varying formats

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. **Test the Upload**
```bash
# Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Go to: http://localhost:3000/en/dashboard/inventory/upload
# Upload one of your Excel files
```

### 2. **Test Each Manufacturer**
- Upload `1-DC_Stock_List_MASTER_10_23_25.xlsx` to Diamond Cargo box
- Upload `QUALITY_CARGO_OPEN_STOCK_10-24.xlsx` to Quality Cargo box
- Check toast notifications for success/failure

### 3. **Verify in Database**
```bash
# Check what was imported
pnpm prisma studio

# Navigate to Trailer model
# Search by manufacturer: "Diamond Cargo" or "Quality Cargo"
```

## üîÑ Next: Automation Chain

**What this enables:**

1. **Email Extraction** (Phase 2)
   - Gmail watches for Daily sheets from suppliers
   - Automatically downloads attachments
   - Stores them in `/uploads` folder

2. **Daily Cron Job** (Phase 3)
   - Vercel cron runs daily at 8 AM UTC
   - Hits `/api/cron/sync-inventory`
   - Pulls files from `/uploads`
   - Calls `/api/inventory/upload-excel` internally
   - Complete automation - zero manual work

3. **OpenAI Agent** (Phase 4)
   - Can trigger uploads on-demand
   - Reports inventory changes
   - Alerts on pricing updates

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Database Schema (Already Exists)
```prisma
model Trailer {
  vin          String   @unique
  manufacturer String   // "Diamond Cargo", "Quality Cargo"
  model        String
  salePrice    Float
  status       String   @default("available")
  images       String[] // Array of image URLs
  // ... 20+ other fields
}

model UploadReport {
  fileName      String
  manufacturer  String
  totalInUpload Int
  newTrailers   Int
  updatedTrailers Int
  newVins       String[]
  errors        Json?
}
```

### API Endpoint
```
POST /api/inventory/upload-excel
- Requires: authentication + owner/director role
- Accepts: FormData with file + manufacturer name
- Returns: { success, summary, reportId, newVins, updatedVins }
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **File Format**: Only `.xlsx` files accepted (Excel 2007+)
2. **Authentication**: Only owners/directors can upload
3. **VIN Uniqueness**: VIN is the primary key - duplicates update existing records
4. **Image Paths**: Must be in `/public/images/trailers/` named by VIN (e.g., `116315.jpg`)
5. **Error Handling**: Bad rows are skipped, not the entire upload

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload Diamond Cargo file ‚Üí Check success toast
- [ ] Check Prisma Studio ‚Üí Verify trailers created
- [ ] Upload Quality Cargo file ‚Üí Check different columns parsed correctly
- [ ] Upload duplicate VIN ‚Üí Verify price updates instead of creating new record
- [ ] Check upload history ‚Üí View `UploadReport` records in database
- [ ] Test role protection ‚Üí Try uploading as salesperson (should fail)
- [ ] Build TypeScript ‚Üí `pnpm typecheck` should pass
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel ‚Üí `vercel --prod`

## üéì Future Enhancements

1. **Image Generation**
   - Generate 3D mockup if VIN image not found
   - Use supplier-specific colors

2. **Panther Separation**
   - Create separate inventory page for Panther
   - Toggle between "Enclosed Trailers" / "Dump & Open Trailers"

3. **Email Auto-Sync**
   - Gmail watcher for supplier emails
   - Auto-download and process daily

4. **Vonage SMS Integration**
   - Send alerts on new inventory
   - Price drop notifications

5. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Inventory turnover rates
   - Pricing trends over time
   - Import success/error metrics

## üí° Key Design Decisions

1. **Why Separate Parsers?** Each manufacturer has unique column structures
2. **Why VIN as Primary Key?** Only reliable unique identifier across all suppliers
3. **Why Role-Based Access?** Prevent salesperson from uploading incorrect data
4. **Why UploadReport Model?** Audit trail + debugging help
5. **Why Store Cost?** Future analytics and pricing formula improvements

## üìû Support

Questions about the parser?
- Check column mappings above
- Review the Excel files: check which row headers start
- Test with sample data first
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

All errors are logged to the server console with row numbers!
