2. **Click "Add Domain"**
3. **Enter**: `mjsalesdash.com`
4. **Click "Add"**

---

### Step 3: Add DNS Records to Your Domain (10 minutes)

**You'll see 3 types of records in Resend:**

#### Record 1: SPF (TXT Record)
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:resend.net ~all
```

#### Record 2: DKIM (TXT Record)
```
Type: TXT
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: [Long string provided by Resend - copy exactly]
```

#### Record 3: DMARC (TXT Record) - Optional but Recommended
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:kencestero@gmail.com
```

---

### Step 4: Where to Add These Records

**Question: Where is mjsalesdash.com registered?**

Common registrars:
- **Vercel**: Dashboard ‚Üí Domains ‚Üí DNS Records

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click: "Domains" (left sidebar)
3. Find: mjsalesdash.com
4. Click: "Manage" or "DNS"

## üìß Recommended Email Addresses

### System Emails (Generic, Professional)

```
noreply@mjsalesdash.com     ‚Üí System notifications, no replies expected
quotes@mjsalesdash.com      ‚Üí Quote emails (replies go to rep's Gmail)
support@mjsalesdash.com     ‚Üí Support emails
team@mjsalesdash.com        ‚Üí General team emails
admin@mjsalesdash.com       ‚Üí Admin notifications
```

### Individual Rep Emails (Optional, Advanced)

If you want each rep to have their own @mjsalesdash.com email:

```
kencestero@mjsalesdash.com

```

**Note**: This requires Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 to create actual mailboxes. For now, using generic emails with reply-to is easier and cheaper!

## üîç Troubleshooting

### DNS Records Not Verifying

**Issue**: Resend shows "Pending" or "Failed" after 30 minutes

**Solutions**:
1. Double-check you added records exactly as shown (copy/paste)
2. Make sure Type is "TXT" (not CNAME or A)
3. For SPF, Name should be `@` (not blank, not domain name)
4. For DKIM, Name should be `resend._domainkey` exactly
5. Wait 24 hours (DNS can be slow)
6. Contact your domain registrar support

### Emails Going to Spam

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure domain is verified (all 3 records green)
2. Add DMARC record if you haven't
3. Send test to yourself first, mark as "Not Spam"
4. Avoid spam trigger words in subject lines
5. Ask customers to add noreply@mjsalesdash.com to contacts

### No Email Received

**Solutions**:
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Check Resend dashboard ‚Üí Emails ‚Üí See delivery status
3. Make sure API key is added to Vercel correctly
4. Redeploy: `vercel deploy --prod`
5. Check browser console for errors at `/email-center`

### Wrong "From" Name or Email

**Update in Vercel**:
```bash
vercel env rm RESEND_FROM_EMAIL
vercel env add RESEND_FROM_EMAIL
# Enter new value: "Your Name <email@mjsalesdash.com>"
vercel deploy --prod
```
