üîç How to Read the Diamond Cargo Inventory Sheet (MJ Format)

Each row in the stock list (e.g., from 1-DC Stock List MASTER 7.21.25.pdf) represents one trailer, and is made up of several key components. Let‚Äôs walk through them.

‚úÖ 1. Model Code (Size and Axles)

Example: 7X16TA2

7X16: 7 feet wide, 16 feet long

SA: Single Axle

TA: Tandem Axle (2 axles)

TA2: Tandem Axle, 3500 lb axles

TA3: Tandem Axle, 5200 lb axles

TA4: Tandem Axle, 6000 lb axles

üìå TA3 or TA4 often indicate a heavier-duty trailer with more payload capacity (popular for mobile business builds or concession).

‚úÖ 2. Exterior Code (Panel Thickness + Color)

Example: B.030 or W.080

This section encodes both the metal thickness and the trailer color.

.030 = Aluminum skin (standard, cost-effective)

.080 = PolyCor skin (premium, ultra-flat, dent-resistant)

Color Codes:

B = Black

W = White

R = Red

CG = Charcoal Gray

SF = Silver Frost

EG = Emerald Green

BW = Black/White (two-tone)

ORG/B = Orange/Black two-tone

ELG = Light Grey

AB, IB, etc. = Accent colors

üìò Refer to the [PolyCor vs Aluminum Comparison PDF] for a visual and durability breakdown.

‚úÖ 3. Door Configurations

Look for these abbreviations in the model or notes column:

DD = Double Doors (barn-style rear doors)

R = Ramp Door

FF = Flat Front

VN = V-Nose

SV = Side Vents

SRW = Side Ramp with Wall

SVN = Slanted V-Nose

‚úÖ 4. Height

Often shown separately like: HT: 6‚Äô6‚Äù or 7‚Äô

Default heights are:

5' on 5wides

6'3" or 6‚Äô6‚Äù on 6x10 or 6x12

7‚Äô or 7‚Äô6‚Äù on larger trailers

Always check if height has been upgraded in the notes (customers commonly ask for standing headroom).

‚úÖ 5. Color and Finish

Look in the EXT COLOR and FINISH fields.

Black Out PKG = Black trim, rims, fenders, and bar locks ‚Äì a popular upgrade.

ATP = Aluminum tread plate (trim along front or corners)

RAW LUAN = unfinished wood interior walls

VINYL WALLS/CEILINGS = Finished, cleanable, white interior

RTP FLOOR = Rubber tread plate floor (great for motorcycles or cleaning)

‚úÖ 6. Options in Notes Section

Examples of what you might find:

3x5 Concession Door w/ Glass

13,500 BTU AC w/ Heat Strip

50 AMP Electrical Package

12V Battery w/ Trickle Charger

Ladder Racks + Walk-On Roof

Coin Flooring = Industrial-style rubberized tile floor

Winch Plate or Generator Box

E-Track or D-Rings (tie-down systems)

Each note is shorthand for a pre-installed upgrade or configuration choice. These typically match items found in the Diamond Cargo Option Sheet.

‚úÖ 7. Dates and Discounts

DATE = When the trailer was completed or added to the system

DISCOUNTED PRICE = May reflect damage or markdown ‚Äì often negotiable

Notes like ‚Äúcan be taken as is with additional discount‚Äù = indicates cosmetic damage, not structural

‚úÖ 8. Understanding VIN / Serial Codes

Each trailer starts with a unique VIN

Reps can use the VIN to locate specific trailer images in the official Dropbox photo folder:
