## Overview

This document summarizes the complete CRM system build that was implemented for MJ Cargo SalesDash. The system includes:

- **Rep tracking system** with unique rep codes
- **Manager assignment** during signup
- **Enhanced customer profiles** with lead tracking
- **Activity logging system**
- **Public credit applications** with rep code tracking
- **User management dashboard** for owners/directors
- **Calendar system** with database integration

**Initial Context:**
- Template: DashTail Next.js template
- Already had: 472 customers imported from Google Sheets
- Already had: Basic CRM structure, calendar functionality
- Framework: Next.js 14, Prisma ORM, NextAuth.js, PostgreSQL (Neon)

---

## Initial Issues Fixed

### 1. Calendar System Fix

**Problem:** Calendar tab showing black screen with "Something went wrong Try Again" error

**Root Cause:**
- Using mock data with axios
- No database integration
- API calls failing due to missing environment variables

**Solution Implemented:**
- âœ… Added `CalendarEvent` model to Prisma schema
- âœ… Updated API routes (`/api/calendars/route.ts`, `/api/calendars/[id]/route.ts`)
- âœ… Added authentication and role-based permissions
- âœ… Implemented company announcements for owners/managers
- âœ… Fixed import: Changed from `import prisma from "@/lib/generated/prisma"` to `import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma"`

**Files Modified:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added CalendarEvent model (lines 645-679)
- `app/api/calendars/route.ts` - Rewrote to use Prisma with auth
- `app/api/calendars/[id]/route.ts` - Created individual event CRUD operations

**Key Features:**
- Personal events (visible only to creator)
- Company announcements (visible to all, only owners/managers can create)
- Role-based permissions
- Event categories: business, personal, holiday, family, meeting

---

### 2. CRM Customer Display Fix

**Problem:** CRM page showing 0 customers despite 472 imported

**Root Cause:** Wrong Prisma import path in API route

**Solution:**
- âœ… Fixed `/api/crm/customers/route.ts` - Changed import to `import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma"`
- âœ… Created `/api/crm/customers/[id]/route.ts` for individual customer operations
- âœ… Verified 472 customers now accessible

---

## Database Schema Changes

### 1. UserProfile Model Updates

**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma` (lines 107-123)

**Fields Added:**
```prisma
// Rep Tracking & Organization
repCode         String?  @unique // Format: "REP" + 6 digits (e.g., "REP482756"), "REP000000" for freelancers
managerId       String?  // Links to another User's id (their manager)
status          String   @default("employee") // "employee" or "freelancer"
```

**Indexes Added:**
```prisma
@@index([repCode])
@@index([managerId])
```

**Purpose:** Track sales representatives with unique codes, assign managers, differentiate employees from freelancers

---

### 2. Customer Model Updates

**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma` (lines 203-209)

stockNumber     String?  // Stock # or null if factory order
isFactoryOrder  Boolean  @default(false)
appliedDate     DateTime? // Date customer applied
assignedManager String?  // Manager name
```

**Status Field Updated:**
```prisma

```

**Purpose:** Capture manager selection and employment status during signup, before email verification

---

### 4. CalendarEvent Model (New)

**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma` (lines 645-679)

**Complete Model:**

model CalendarEvent {
  id              String   @id @default(cuid())

  // Event Details
  title           String
  description     String?  @db.Text
  start           DateTime
  end             DateTime

```

---

**Backend File:** `app/api/join/register/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- âœ… Accepts `managerId` and `status` from request body (line 23)

  repCode = "REP000000";
} else {
  let isUnique = false;
  repCode = "";
  while (!isUnique) {
    const randomDigits = Math.floor(100000 + Math.random() * 900000).toString();
    repCode = `REP${randomDigits}`;

    const existing = await prisma.userProfile.findUnique({
      where: { repCode },
    });
    if (!existing) {
      isUnique = true;
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 6. Public Credit Application with Rep Tracking âœ…

**Frontend File:** `app/credit-application/[repCode]/page.tsx`

- âœ… Error handling for invalid rep codes
- âœ… Success page after submission:
  - Application number displayed
  - Rep information shown
  - Confirmation message
  - What happens next checklist
- âœ… Uses existing `CreditApplicationForm` component

**Rep Code Validation:**
- Calls `/api/validate-rep/[repCode]`
- Shows loading spinner during validation
- Shows error banner if invalid
- Allows submission even if code invalid (unassigned app)

---

**Validation API File:** `app/api/validate-rep/[repCode]/route.ts`

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/validate-rep/[repCode]`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "repCode": "REP482756",
  "repName": "John Smith",
  "userId": "cuid_user_id"
}
```

**Logic:**
- Looks up `repCode` in `UserProfile` table
- Returns rep's first/last name or user.name
- Returns 404 if code not found
- No authentication required (public endpoint)

---

**Credit App API Update:** `app/api/credit-applications/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- âœ… **Rep Code Lookup** (lines 158-172)
  - When public submission includes `shareToken` (rep code)
  - Looks up UserProfile by repCode
  - Gets userId and assigns to `createdBy` field
  - Application automatically assigned to rep

- âœ… **CreatedBy Assignment** (line 221)
  - Uses `session?.user?.id || createdByUserId`
  - Authenticated users: uses session user ID
  - Public submissions: uses looked-up rep user ID

**Flow:**
1. Customer visits `https://mjcargotrailers.com/credit-application/REP482756`
2. Frontend validates rep code
3. Customer fills out form
4. Form submits with `shareToken: "REP482756"`
5. Backend looks up rep by code
6. Application assigned to rep's `userId` in `createdBy` field
7. Rep sees application in their dashboard

---

### 7. User Management Dashboard âœ…

**Frontend File:** `app/[lang]/(dashboard)/(admin)/user-management/page.tsx`

```

---

**Backend API File:** `app/api/admin/users/route.ts`

**GET /api/admin/users**

**Permission Logic:**
```typescript
// Only owners and directors can access
if (!["owner", "director"].includes(currentUser.profile.role)) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "Insufficient permissions" },
    { status: 403 }
  );
}
```

### 8. Sidebar Menu Updates âœ…

**File:** `config/menus.ts`

```typescript
{
  title: "User Management",
  icon: Users,
  href: "/user-management",
}
```

**Location:** Added to "Application" section, after "Manager Access"

**Note:** The sidebar link is visible to ALL users, but the page itself has role-based protection (owners/directors only). Non-authorized users will see a 403 error if they try to access it.

---

```

**New Response:**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "cuid",
    "name": "John Smith",

  }
}
```

4. Emily Davis
5. David Wilson
6. Jessica Brown
7. Chris Anderson

### Role Hierarchy:

## Important Notes

### Security Considerations:
- âœ… All admin endpoints protected with role checks
- âœ… Public credit app endpoint has no auth (intentional)
- âœ… Rep code validation is public (needed for customer-facing page)
- âœ… Activity creation requires authentication
- âœ… Customer data accessible only to authenticated users

### Performance Optimizations:
- âœ… Database indexes added for frequently queried fields
- âœ… Rep code uniqueness check uses database query (not in-memory)
- âœ… User management fetches manager names in batch

### Known Limitations:
- Manager list is hardcoded (could be made dynamic with database query)
- Sidebar shows "User Management" to all users (protection is page-level, not menu-level)
- No email notifications yet for credit app submissions
- No SMS notifications for rep code sharing

### Future Enhancements (Not Implemented):
- Email notifications when customer submits credit app via rep link
- SMS sharing of rep links
- QR code generation for rep links
- Analytics dashboard showing rep performance
- Commission tracking based on rep code
- Customer journey tracking from rep link to deal close

---

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Set `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable
- [ ] Set `DATABASE_URL` for Neon PostgreSQL
- [ ] Run `npx prisma generate` on server
- [ ] Run `npx prisma db push` to sync schema
- [ ] Verify all API routes are accessible
- [ ] Test rep code generation creates unique codes
- [ ] Test credit app submission with rep code
- [ ] Verify user management permissions
- [ ] Test calendar system with different roles
- [ ] Verify email hiding logic for placeholder emails
- [ ] Test lead age timer updates correctly
- [ ] Confirm activity logging works end-to-end
