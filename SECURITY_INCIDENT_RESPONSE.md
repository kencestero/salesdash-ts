# üö® URGENT: Credential Rotation Guide

**STATUS:** Secrets were exposed in git history on commit `1db9164`
**FILES:** `.env.production.test` and `scripts/verify-user.js`
**ACTION TAKEN:** Files removed from git history, force-pushed to GitHub
**NEXT STEPS:** You MUST rotate ALL exposed credentials immediately

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Exposed Credentials (CRITICAL)

The following secrets were publicly exposed and MUST be rotated:

### 1. ‚ùå DATABASE_URL (CRITICAL - ROTATE IMMEDIATELY)

**What was exposed:** PostgreSQL connection string with password
**Risk:** Full database access - anyone can read/write/delete all data
**Action Required:** Change database password NOW

#### How to Rotate:

**Go to Neon Dashboard:**
1. Visit https://console.neon.tech
2. Select your project: `salesdash-ts` or similar
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Reset Password
4. Generate new password
5. Copy the new DATABASE_URL connection string

**Update Vercel:**
```bash
# Remove old value
vercel env rm DATABASE_URL production

# Add new value
vercel env add DATABASE_URL production
# Paste new connection string when prompted

# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

---

### 2. ‚ùå AUTH_SECRET (CRITICAL - ROTATE IMMEDIATELY)

**What was exposed:** NextAuth session encryption key
**Risk:** Session hijacking, authentication bypass
**Action Required:** Generate new secret

#### How to Rotate:

```bash
# Generate new secret (32 characters, base64 encoded)
openssl rand -base64 32

# Update in Vercel
vercel env rm AUTH_SECRET production
vercel env add AUTH_SECRET production
# Paste the output from openssl command above

# Note: This will log out all users - that's expected and safe
```

---

### 3. ‚ùå GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY (CRITICAL - ROTATE IMMEDIATELY)

**What was exposed:** Google Cloud service account private key
**Risk:** Full access to Google Services (Sheets, Drive, etc.)
**Action Required:** Revoke old key and create new service account key

#### How to Rotate:

**Go to Google Cloud Console:**
1. Visit https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Go to IAM & Admin ‚Üí Service Accounts
3. Find your service account (likely `mj-cargo-dashboard-service-acc@...`)
4. Click on it ‚Üí Keys tab
5. **DELETE the old key** (very important!)
6. Click "Add Key" ‚Üí "Create new key" ‚Üí JSON
7. Download the JSON file

**Extract the private key from the JSON:**
The downloaded file contains:
```json
{
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
```

**Update Vercel:**
```bash
vercel env rm GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY production
vercel env add GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY production
# Paste the FULL private_key value (include \n characters)

vercel env rm GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL production
vercel env add GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL production
# Paste the client_email value
```

---

### 4. ‚ùå OUTSETA_API_KEY & OUTSETA_API_SECRET (HIGH PRIORITY)

**What was exposed:** Outseta API credentials
**Risk:** Access to Outseta account, customer data, billing
**Action Required:** Regenerate API credentials

#### How to Rotate:

**Go to Outseta Dashboard:**
1. Visit your Outseta account (check OUTSETA_BASE_URL for the domain)
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí API or Integrations
3. Click "Regenerate API Key" or similar
4. Copy new API Key and Secret

**Update Vercel:**
```bash
vercel env rm OUTSETA_API_KEY production
vercel env add OUTSETA_API_KEY production
# Paste new API key

vercel env rm OUTSETA_API_SECRET production
vercel env add OUTSETA_API_SECRET production
# Paste new API secret
```

---

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è FIREBASE Credentials (MEDIUM - Public is OK, but can rotate)

**What was exposed:** Firebase API keys and project IDs
**Risk:** LOW - These are designed to be public (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`)
**Note:** Firebase security relies on Firestore rules, not API key secrecy

#### If you want to rotate anyway:

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project
3. Project Settings ‚Üí General
4. Under "Your apps" ‚Üí Web apps ‚Üí Delete old app
5. Click "Add app" ‚Üí Web
6. Register new app and copy new config
7. Update all `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` vars in Vercel

**Variables to update:**
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID

---

### 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN (LOW - Auto-rotates)

**What was exposed:** Vercel deployment token
**Risk:** LOW - This token auto-expires and regenerates
**Action:** No action needed - Vercel handles this automatically

---

### 7. ‚ö†Ô∏è Other Exposed Values (Review and Update)

These were also exposed but are lower risk:
- **APPS_SCRIPT_URL** - If sensitive, redeploy script with new URL
- **PLASMIC_PUBLIC_TOKEN** - Public by design, can rotate in Plasmic dashboard
- **INVENTORY_CSV** - Google Sheets URL, change sharing settings if needed
- **INVITE_CODE** - Change to a new random code
- **SIGNUP_CODE** - Change to a new value

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Rotation Checklist

Use this to track your progress:

- [ ] **DATABASE_URL** - Reset password in Neon Dashboard
- [ ] **AUTH_SECRET** - Generate new with `openssl rand -base64 32`
- [ ] **GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY** - Delete old key, create new in Google Cloud
- [ ] **GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL** - Update from new service account JSON
- [ ] **OUTSETA_API_KEY** - Regenerate in Outseta dashboard
- [ ] **OUTSETA_API_SECRET** - Regenerate in Outseta dashboard
- [ ] **FIREBASE_*** (Optional) - Create new Firebase web app
- [ ] **APPS_SCRIPT_URL** (If sensitive) - Redeploy Google Apps Script
- [ ] **INVITE_CODE** - Change to new random value
- [ ] **SIGNUP_CODE** - Change to new random value
- [ ] **Update all values in Vercel** - Use `vercel env` commands
- [ ] **Redeploy to Vercel** - Run `vercel --prod`
- [ ] **Test the application** - Make sure auth and DB work

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices (Going Forward)

### DO:
‚úÖ Always use environment variables for secrets
‚úÖ Keep `.env*` files in `.gitignore` (already configured)
‚úÖ Use Vercel dashboard to manage production secrets
‚úÖ Rotate credentials regularly (every 90 days)
‚úÖ Use different credentials for dev/staging/production
‚úÖ Enable 2FA on all service accounts

### DON'T:
‚ùå Commit any `.env` files to git
‚ùå Put secrets in documentation files
‚ùå Share credentials in Slack/Discord/email
‚ùå Use production credentials locally
‚ùå Create test/debug scripts with hardcoded credentials

## üîç How to Verify Git History is Clean

```bash
# Search for database username (should return nothing)
git log -S "neondb_owner" --all

# Search for removed files (should only show deletion commits)
git log --all --full-history -- .env.production.test

# Check GitHub repository
# Visit: https://github.com/kencestero/salesdash-ts
# Search for "postgresql://" - should find ZERO results
```

---

## üìû Troubleshooting

### Database connection fails after rotation:
- Double-check the new DATABASE_URL format is correct
- Ensure Neon database is active (not paused)
- Verify no typos in the connection string
- Check that the password has no special characters needing escaping

### Auth not working after rotation:
- Clear browser cookies/sessions
- Verify AUTH_SECRET is exactly what openssl generated
- Check NEXTAUTH_URL matches your Vercel domain
- Try logging out and back in

### Google Sheets integration broken:
- Verify GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY includes `\n` newline characters
- Check GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL matches the new service account
- Ensure service account still has "Editor" access to the spreadsheet
- Wait 5-10 minutes for Google to propagate new keys

### GitGuardian alerts still showing:
- Wait 30-60 minutes (scanning/indexing takes time)
- Force-refresh the GitGuardian dashboard
- Verify git history is actually clean (see commands above)
- Contact GitGuardian support if alerts persist after 24 hours

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimate

- Database password: 5 minutes
- AUTH_SECRET: 2 minutes
- Google Service Account: 10 minutes
- Outseta API: 5 minutes
- Update Vercel environment variables: 5 minutes
- Redeploy and test: 10 minutes

**Total: ~40 minutes**

---

## üéØ Priority Order

If you're short on time, rotate in this order:

1. **DATABASE_URL** (5 min) ‚Üê MOST CRITICAL
2. **AUTH_SECRET** (2 min)
3. **GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY** (10 min)
4. **OUTSETA_API_KEY/SECRET** (5 min)
5. Everything else (optional, lower risk)

---

## üìã What Was Done to Remediate

‚úÖ Removed `.env.production.test` from git history
‚úÖ Removed `scripts/verify-user.js` from git history
‚úÖ Force-pushed cleaned history to GitHub
‚úÖ Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future accidents
‚úÖ Created this rotation guide

**Next:** You must rotate the exposed credentials (see checklist above)

---

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Do not delay rotation. Secrets were public for several hours and may have been cached by web scrapers or security scanners.

---

**Questions?** This is a security incident - prioritize credential rotation over other work. The application will continue working until you rotate, but the old credentials are compromised.
