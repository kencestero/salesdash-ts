## What You Must Do Now (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your Resend API Key from Dashboard

1. Go to your Resend dashboard: https://resend.com/api-keys
2. You should see your API key (starts with `re_`)
3. Copy the entire key

**If you don't have an API key yet:**
- Click "Create API Key"
- Name: `MJ Sales Dashboard`
- Permission: Full Access
- Click Create and copy the key

---

### Step 2: Add API Key to Vercel Environment Variables

**Option A: Using Vercel CLI (Fastest)**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if needed
npm i -g vercel

# Add the API key
vercel env add RESEND_API_KEY

# When prompted:
# 1. Paste your API key (re_xxxxx...)
# 2. Select ALL environments: Production, Preview, Development (use spacebar)
# 3. Press Enter

# Also add the FROM email
vercel env add RESEND_FROM_EMAIL

# When prompted:
# 1. Type: MJ Cargo <noreply@mjsalesdash.com>
# 2. Select ALL environments
# 3. Press Enter
```

**Option B: Using Vercel Dashboard (Web Interface)**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: **salesdash-ts**
3. Click "Settings" tab
4. Click "Environment Variables" in left sidebar
5. Click "Add New" button
6. **First Variable:**
   - Key: `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - Value: `re_your_actual_key_here` (paste from Resend dashboard)
   - Environments: Check ALL (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click "Save"
7. **Second Variable:**
   - Key: `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`
   - Value: `MJ Cargo <noreply@mjsalesdash.com>`
   - Environments: Check ALL
   - Click "Save"

---

### Step 3: Redeploy Your Application

The code changes need to be deployed with the new environment variables.

**Push the code changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement email verification with Resend"
git push
```

This will automatically trigger a deployment on Vercel (takes 2-3 minutes).

---

### Step 4: Test with MJCARGOTRAILERS@GMAIL.COM

After deployment completes:

1. Have the owner try registering again:
   - Go to: https://salesdash-ts.vercel.app/en/join
   - Enter the secret owner code
   - Fill out the registration form
   - **This time, the email WILL be sent!**

2. Check the email inbox: **MJCARGOTRAILERS@GMAIL.COM**
   - Look for email from: **MJ Cargo <noreply@mjsalesdash.com>**
   - Subject: **"Verify Your Email - MJ Cargo Sales Dashboard"**
   - Check spam folder if not in inbox

3. Click the "Verify Email Address" button in the email

4. User will be fully registered and can sign in!

## How Email Verification Now Works

### Registration Flow:
1. User enters owner code ‚Üí validates
2. User fills out registration form
3. **NEW**: System creates user account with `emailVerified: null`
4. **NEW**: System generates verification token (24 hour expiry)
5. **NEW**: System sends branded email via Resend with verification link
6. User receives email and clicks verification link
7. System verifies token and sets `emailVerified: Date`
8. User can now sign in and access dashboard

### Email Template:
The verification email uses the MJ Cargo branded template:
- Orange header with "MJ CARGO TRAILERS" logo
- Professional welcome message
- Clear "Verify Email Address" button (orange)
- 24-hour expiration notice
- Professional footer with branding

---

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received After Adding API Key?

1. **Check Vercel Logs:**
   ```bash
   vercel logs --since 5m
   ```
   Look for:
   - ‚úÖ `Email sent successfully` - Email was sent
   - ‚ùå `Failed to send verification email` - API key issue

2. **Check Resend Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://resend.com/emails
   - See if email appears in sent list
   - Check delivery status

3. **Check Spam Folder:**
   - Gmail often puts verification emails in spam initially
   - Mark as "Not Spam" if found there

4. **Check Domain Verification:**
   - Go to: https://resend.com/domains
   - Make sure mjsalesdash.com shows:
     - ‚úÖ SPF: Verified
     - ‚úÖ DKIM: Verified
     - ‚úÖ DMARC: Verified

5. **Redeploy Again:**
   ```bash
   vercel deploy --prod --force
   ```

## What Happens to Existing Unverified User?

If MJCARGOTRAILERS@GMAIL.COM already has an account but hasn't verified:

**Option 1: Delete the old account** (easiest for testing)
You'll need to manually delete from database, or wait for automatic cleanup.

**Option 2: Resend verification email** (need to implement)
We can add a "Resend Verification Email" button if needed.

**Option 3: Manually verify in database**
Update the user record to set `emailVerified` to current date.

---

## Verifying the Fix

After deployment, check these logs to confirm it's working:

1. **Registration Logs** (in Vercel or terminal):
   ```
   === Registration Request ===

   ‚úÖ User created: [user-id]
   ‚úÖ UserProfile created
   ‚úÖ Verification token created

   ‚úÖ Verification email sent successfully  ‚Üê THIS IS NEW
   ```

2. **Resend Dashboard**:
