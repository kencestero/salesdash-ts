## 🔒 Security Improvements Made

### Pre-Commit Protection
**File:** `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
- Blocks commits with secret patterns
- Prevents `.env` files from being committed
- Enhanced error messages with remediation steps

### Git Ignore Updated
**Files protected:**
- `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`
- `.claude/settings.local.json`
- `backups/` directory

### Safe Templates Created
- [.env.template](.env.template) - Safe for repository
- [SECURITY-AUDIT-REPORT.md](SECURITY-AUDIT-REPORT.md) - Full audit details
- [SECURITY-INCIDENT-RESPONSE.md](SECURITY-INCIDENT-RESPONSE.md) - Rotation guide
- [SECRET-ROTATION-CHECKLIST.md](SECRET-ROTATION-CHECKLIST.md) - Step-by-step guide
